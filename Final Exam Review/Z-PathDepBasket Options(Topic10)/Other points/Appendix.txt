* Difference between virtual functions and pure virtual functions:

A virtual function is a function declared in a base class that can be overridden in a derived class. When a derived class overrides a virtual function, 
it provides its own implementation of the function that is called instead of the base class's implementation when the function is called on an object of the derived class.

A pure virtual function is a virtual function that is declared in a base class but has no implementation. 
A class that contains a pure virtual function is called an abstract class,and it cannot be instantiated. 
Instead, it is meant to be derived from, and any derived class must provide an implementation for the pure virtual function. 
If a derived class does not provide an implementation for a pure virtual function, then it is also an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.

In summary, the main difference between virtual functions and pure virtual functions is that virtual functions have an implementation in the base class, 
but can be overridden in a derived class, while pure virtual functions have no implementation in the base class and must be overridden in any derived class.
