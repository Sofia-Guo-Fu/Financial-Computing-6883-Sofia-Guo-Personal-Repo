* Version 1 is the simplest version of European call option pricing. 
* Version 2 added "function pointers" to compute different payoff functions
* Version 3 created our first class of BinomialTreeModel
* Version 4 further created another class called "OptionCalculation" to perform PriceByCRR
* Version 5 incorporates inheritance and polymorphism to gurantee the pricing for different European options
* Version 6 extends the pricing further to American options by defining a "PriceBySnell" function
* Version 7 creates a new class called "BinLattice" to display the prices of American options at each node
* Version 8 incorporates function templates to show both the PriceTree and StoppingTree of American Options.
