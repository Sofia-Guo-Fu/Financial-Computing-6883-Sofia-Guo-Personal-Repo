This version 3 is different from version 2 in that it creats our first class BinomialTreeModel, that will be constantly used in future versions
Apart from this class, the Option03.h/.cpp files still keeps the function pointers 


It has the following files:

*BinomialTreeModel02.h/.cpp:

class BinomialTreeModel: 
    private data members: double S0,U,D,R
    public member functions:
        double RiskNeutProb();
        double CalculateAssetPrice(int n, int i) const; 
        void UpdateBinomialTreeModel(double S0_, double U_, double D_, double R_)
        int GetInputData(); 
        And four get functions to access private data memebrs:
        double GetR() const; double GetS0() const; double GetU() const; double GetD() const;
        

* Option03.h/.cpp
independent functions:
    int GetInputData(int &N, int &K); 
    double *PriceByCRR(BinomialTreeModel & Model, int N, double K, double (*Payoff)(double z, double K)); 
     -----We can see from here the pack of parameters (S0,U,D,R) has been encapsulated in the BinomialTreeModel class, and passed by reference
    finally, we have the pay off functions:
    double CallPayoff(double z, double K);
    double PutPayoff(double z, double K);
